Thankfully the data structures were not too confusing to understand or I would be crying right now lol. I did learn what a Binary heap is and the simple difference between min heap and max heap. I do need to figure out how to manage my time better so I can take more time to review the material covered during lecture and rewatch the recordings to help my understanding of it.",

The good thing is that we don't have to make the server, we just need to implement it for a new learning journal project we are starting. It was great following during lecture and then a bit slower trying to implement the same thing during lab. I think I get the basics of what we learned, but need to go over the notes and reading to cement what I think i know.",

I really enjoyed hearing from past python grads about their experience with the class and how they are doing now. I hope there is not too much assigned tomorrow or for this weekend.. I already have some catching up to do... but then again, I know we will definitely have more work assigned haha, looking forward to the next challenge.",

I feel like I am understanding most everything that we are covering so far, and have great partners for both assignments that help me with the areas  I don't feel so confident in. I am still a little blurry with how to use supers, and inheriting from a different class... we implemented it on our doubly linked list, and succeeded on one of the functions we made but not on the second. I am not very sure why, and need to do some more reading on it..... honestly I could use a good day just to read up on the http/classes/supers...etc to get some more confidence in my understanding of them. The white board challenge went really well, its amazing how things get easier when you write them down and map out what you need to do. I look forward to more of these challenges.",

Still having a couple dumb issues with the sockets and http requests and response.. but so far i donâ€™t feel out of depth. Keeping up with the reading helps soooooo much. Anyways back to reading and hopefully learning some more. My brain is so full rn though...",

I am going over the web sockets because it seems simple enough, but I have been having a few issues implementing what I read in the assignment. Linked lists have been a lot easier to understand, and i am  understanding how to set up classes and test them. Now back to reading...",

The one good thing from today was that I understand tox much better now. Thank you Gabe! this does not feel like a weekend... no bueno.. and theres more hw to do.... bye life haha",

I don't like how python2 and python3 differ and that we have to account for how code responds differently depending on which one we use. I also didn't understand the Python packaging very well and need to review it farther. Feeling a little like I did in 201 and I hear that it starts getting hard in week 2 haha. I see lots of late nights ahead.",

I made a twitter account, and I signed up for a lightning talk... not sure what I will talk about in the lightning talk or if I will use twitter that much, but who knows. \r\nLearning about testing was great, I am sure we will learn quite a bit more about it and look forward to it. I like the fact that we can write tests to make sure our code is working the way we want it to work, this will come in handy once we start working on larger projects. All in all it was a good day and I feel like I understood everything that we went over in class.",

        "text": "Python... A new journey in learning. It was interesting to learn about some of the differences between the python2 and python3, seems like we might be switching back and forth a bit.... might get confusing. Setting up different environments for every project seems like a overkill. I do wonder why there isn't a simpler way of setting it up so each project will run on the packages we want it to without making a completely different environment for it. I am excited and nervous about the weeks to come and the learning brain pain that comes with them.",
