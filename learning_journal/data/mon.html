        cookiecutter... pyramids...deques... It's Monday. The good thing is that we don't have to make the server, we just need to implement it for a new learning journal project we are starting. It was great following during lecture and then a bit slower trying to implement the same thing during lab. I think I get the basics of what we learned, but need to go over the notes and reading to cement what I think i know.
